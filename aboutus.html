            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a timeline nobody asked for, three girls — each more talented than a Swiss Army knife —
                were raised by parents who believed that “art is a phase” and “marketing is a pyramid scheme invented
                by printers.”

                Their families had one shared passion: reminding them they would achieve absolutely nothing.

                Fast-forward to destiny losing control of its Google Maps, and BOOM — all three end up at a mysterious NGO called:

                <b>“جمعية الفاشلين لحماية البيئة”</b><br>
                (The Association of Failures for Environmental Protection)

                An organization so confusing it still isn’t sure what it’s protecting.

                Somewhere between recycled plastic and emotional trauma, the girls united, synced their brains like
                Wi-Fi finally connecting, and…

                🦁 <b>Lionesses Marketing Agency</b> was born.

                Not from privilege.
                Not from luck.
                But from SPITE powerful enough to fuel Lebanon’s electricity for a week.

                Today, they’ve helped millions of people who were once told:
                <i>"You're not going anywhere."</i>

                Guess what?

                They went somewhere.
                They built an empire.
                They got a logo.
                And now they charge money for creativity — the ultimate revenge.

            <h2>Then...</h2>
            <p>
                With nothing but caffeine, chaos, and a burning desire to prove everyone wrong, the Lionesses upgraded
                from “three girls with Wi-Fi” into a full-scale marketing agency feared by competitors and adored by
                algorithms.

                They transformed brands, built identities, and broke every rule of “how things are supposed to be done.”

                Their motto?

                <b>If destiny won’t give us a seat at the table, we’ll build a new table — and charge rent.</b>
